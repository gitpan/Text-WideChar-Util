NAME
    Text::WideChar::Util - Routines for text containing wide characters

VERSION
    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::WideChar::Util qw(
         mbpad mbswidth_height mbtrunc mbwrap wrap);

     # get width as well as number of lines
     say mbswidth_height("red\nçº¢è²"); # => [4, 2]

     # wrap text to a certain column width
     say mbwrap("....", 40);

     # pad (left, right, center) text to specified column width, handle multilines
     say mbpad("foo", 10);                          # => "foo       "
     say mbpad("çº¢è²", 10, "left");                 # => "      çº¢è²"
     say mbpad("foo\nbarbaz\n", 10, "center", "."); # => "...foo....\n..barbaz..\n"

     # truncate text to a certain column width
     say mbtrunc("çº¢è²",  2); # => "çº¢"
     say mbtrunc("çº¢è²",  3); # => "çº¢"
     say mbtrunc("çº¢red", 3); # => "çº¢r"

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides routines for dealing with text containing wide
    characters (wide meaning occupying more than 1 column width in
    terminal).

FUNCTIONS
  mbswidth_height($text) => [INT, INT]
    Like Text::CharWidth's mbswidth(), but also gives height (number of
    lines). For example, "mbswidth_height("foobar\nb\n")" gives [6, 3].

  mbwrap($text, $width, \%opts) => STR
    Wrap $text to $width columns. It uses mbswidth() instead of Perl's
    length() which works on a per-character basis.

    Options:

    *   tab_width => INT (default: 8)

        Set tab width.

        Note that tab will only have effect on the indent. Tab between text
        will be replaced with a single space.

    *   flindent => STR

        First line indent. If unspecified, will be deduced from the first
        line of text.

    *   slindent => STD

        Subsequent line indent. If unspecified, will be deduced from the
        second line of text, or if unavailable, will default to empty string
        ("").

    *   return_stats => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to true, then instead of returning the wrapped string,
        function will return "[$wrapped, $stats]" where $stats is a hash
        containing some information like "max_word_width", "min_word_width".

    Performance: ~2300/s on my Core i5-2400 3.1GHz desktop for a ~1KB of
    text.

  wrap($text, $width, \%opts) => STR
    Like mbwrap(), but uses character-based length() instead of column
    width-wise mbswidth(). Provided as an alternative to the venerable
    Text::Wrap's wrap() but with a different behaviour. This module's wrap()
    can reflow newline and its behavior is more akin to Emacs (try reflowing
    a paragraph in Emacs using "M-q").

    Performance: ~3100/s on my Core i5-2400 3.1GHz desktop for a ~1KB of
    text. Text::Wrap::wrap() on the other hand can go ~3800/s.

  mbpad($text, $width[, $which[, $padchar[, $truncate]]]) => STR
    Return $text padded with $padchar to $width columns. $which is either
    "r" or "right" for padding on the right (the default if not specified),
    "l" or "left" for padding on the right, or "c" or "center" or "centre"
    for left+right padding to center the text.

    $padchar is whitespace if not specified. It should be string having the
    width of 1 column.

  mbtrunc($text, $width) => STR
    Truncate $text to $width columns. It uses mbswidth() instead of Perl's
    length(), so it can handle wide characters.

    Does *not* handle multiple lines.

    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

INTERNAL NOTES
    Should we wrap at hyphens? Probably not. Both Emacs as well as
    Text::Wrap do not.

FAQ
  How do I truncate or pad to a certain character length (instead of column width)?
    You can simply use Perl's substr() which works by character.

TODOS
SEE ALSO
    Text::CharWidth which provides mbswidth().

    Text::ANSI::Util which can also handle text containing wide characters
    as well ANSI escape codes.
